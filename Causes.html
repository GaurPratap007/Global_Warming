Until recently, natural factors have been the cause of these <br>changes. Natural influences on the climate include volcanic eruptions, <br>changes in the orbit of the Earth, and shifts in the Earth's crust <br>(known as plate tectonics).<br><br>However, since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s, the global <br>temperature has increased at a much faster rate. By burning fossil fuels<br> and changing how we use the land, human activity has quickly become the<br> leading cause of changes to our climate.<br><br></p>

We call these 'greenhouse gases'. These gases&nbsp;act as a warming blanket around the Earth, known as the 'greenhouse effect'.<br>Greenhouse gases come from both human and natural sources. Gases like<br> carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide naturally occur in the <br>atmosphere. Others, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are only <br>produced by human activity.<br>When short-wave&nbsp;radiation from the sun reaches Earth, most of it <br>passes straight through and hits the surface. The Earth absorbs most of <br>this radiation and gives off longer-wavelength infrared radiation.<br>The greenhouse gases absorb some of this infrared radiation, instead <br>of it passing straight out into space. The atmosphere then emits <br>radiation in all directions, sending some of it back to the surface, <br>causing the planet to heat up. This process is known as the 'greenhouse <br>effect'.<br>Since the Industrial Revolution, we've been adding more and more <br>greenhouse gases into the air, trapping even more heat. Instead of <br>keeping Earth at a warm, stable temperature, the greenhouse effect is <br>heating the planet at a much faster rate. We call this the 'enhanced <br>greenhouse effect'&nbsp;and it's the main cause of climate change.<br><br></p>

    <div style="position: relative;height: 430px;">
        <p style="height: 430px;width: 715.6px;margin-left: 39px;position: relative;">Some amount of climate change can be attributed to natural phenomena. Over the course of Earth’s existence, <span style="color: rgb(6, 0, 3);">volcanic eruptions</span>, fluctuations in solar radiations, tectonic shifts, and even small changes in our orbit&nbsp;have all had observable effects on planetary warming and cooling patterns.<br>Natural cycles can cause the climate to alternate between warming and cooling. There are also natural factors that force the climate to change, known as 'forcings'. <br><br>Some of these natural cycles include:<br><strong>1. Milankovitch cycles</strong> – As Earth travels around the sun, its path and the tilt of its axis can change slightly. These changes, called Milankovitch cycles, affect the amount of sunlight that falls on Earth. This can cause the temperature of Earth to change. <br>However, these cycles take place over tens or hundreds of thousands of <br>years and are unlikely to be causing the changes to the climate that we <br>are seeing today.<br><strong>2. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</strong> – ENSO is a pattern of changing water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. In an 'El Niño' year, the global temperature warms up, and in a 'La Niña' year, it cools down. These patterns can affect the global temperature for a short amount of time (months or years) but cannot explain the persistent warming that we see today.<br><br><br></p>

        <p style="width: 712.6px;margin-left: 41px;height: 104px;position: relative;">Scientists agree that human activity is the primary driver of what we’re seeing now <br>worldwide. &nbsp;The unchecked burning of fossil fuels over the past 150 years has drastically <br>increased the presence of atmospheric greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide.<br><br></p><img style="margin-top: -23px;margin-left: 58px;position: relative;" width="565" height="297" src="assets/img/marek-piwnicki-wizoyyqzuss-unsplash-jpg.webp">
        <p style="width: 747.6px;margin-top: 20px;height: 983px;margin-left: 42px;position: relative;"><strong>Transportation</strong><br>The cars, trucks, ships, and planes that we use to transport ourselves and our goods are a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;Burning petroleum-based fuel in combustion engines releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. <br>Passenger cars account for 41 percent of those emissions, with the typical passenger vehicle emitting about 4.6 metric tones of carbon dioxide per year.<br><br><strong>Generating power</strong><br> Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous <br>oxide – powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat. Globally, a bit more than a quarter of electricity comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources which, as opposed to fossil<br> fuels, emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.<br><br><strong>Cutting down forests</strong><br>Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Each year approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere. Deforestation, together with agriculture and other land use changes, is responsible for roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br><strong>Agriculture</strong><br>The advent of modern, industrialized agriculture&nbsp;has significantly altered the vital but delicate relationship<br> between soil and the climate. This sector is especially notorious for giving off large amounts of nitrous oxide and methane, powerful gases that are highly effective at trapping heat. The widespread adoption of chemical fertilizers, combined with certain crop-management practices that prioritize high yields over soil health, means that agriculture accounts for nearly three-quarters of the nitrous oxide found in our atmosphere. Meanwhile, large-scale industrialized livestock production continues to be a significant source of atmospheric methane, which is emitted as a function of the digestive processes of cattle and other ruminants.<br><br><strong>Oil and gas development</strong><br>Oil and gas lead to emissions at every stage of their production and consumption—not only when they’re burned as fuel, but just as soon as we drill a hole in the ground to begin extracting them. Fossil fuel&nbsp;development is a major source of methane, which invariably leaks from oil and gas operations: drilling, fracking, transporting, and refining. And while methane isn’t as prevalent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide, it’s many times more potent at trapping heat during the first 20 years of its release into the <br>atmosphere. Even abandoned and inoperative wells—sometimes known as "orphaned" wells—leak<br> methane. More than 3 million of these old, defunct wells are spread across the country and were responsible for emitting more than 280,000 metric tons of methane in 2018.<br><br></p>
